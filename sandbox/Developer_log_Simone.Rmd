## 26/05/2024

- Uploaded S3 and R6 draft of Person class.
  
  I think S3 could be a better choice to have more freedom in defining and using methods across different classes and objects in general. This flexibility could be beneficial in terms of defining various key functions to improve the generalization of the package, allowing it to be used with different frameworks and leveraging it effectively.

- Nonetheless, R6 with encapsulation could be more clear from a user's perspective. By defining the main attributes and methods for all classes, it can be used almost in sequence to have a very ordered simulation and scenario. The downside is that it could become a bit too strict in terms of the possible generalitation of the package.

## 27/05/2024

- End of the community bonding period
- Scheduled a meeting on Wednesday
- Studied and reviewed some basic R packages that could be helpful for later simulations

## 29/05/2024

- **Meeting with Mentors:** Discussed the test of the `Person` class and decided to use the S3 OOP system. It was the safer choice, as R6 did not provide significant advantages at this stage.
- Set up the next planned activities for the package development.
- Discussed the probability of success and how to visualize and interpret it.
- Renamed and moved the test of the S3 `Person` class to the `R` folder.

### Planned

- Start developing the `Household` class.
- Study how R packages are built and the best practices in R package development.

## 30/05/2024

- Study Package development in R
- Deleted person_R6_test in Sandbox


##  03/05/2024

### Progress
- Implemented and learned R `roxygen2` grammar to generate comments and documentation.
- Learned about `devtools` and `testthat`.
- Studied package development in R.
- Started developing the `Household` class in the Sandbox:
  - Implemented basic functions such as `summary`, `add_person`, and `total_income`.

### Issues Encountered
- **Summary Function**: The `summary` function does not show the information correctly and returns more metadata than necessary.
- **Total Income Function**: Encountered an error with the `total_income` function, but it should be easily solvable tomorrow.

### Next Steps
- Create a `tests` directory and try to run unit tests on the developed class.

## 05/06/2024

### Progress
-correct the Household error
-Progress in understanding package development
-created test vignette

### Issues Encountered
- Having problem when try to built the package and to load_all(*)
- I have still to understand how the build works in general especially the import and export

## 06/06/2024

In the meeting, we discussed some parameters that could be needed in order to start calculating the probability of success. This should be a list for my own memo and should be expanded with anything I might have missed or not correctly specified.

In general, in addition to Household and the Person Class, we should decide how our income in retirement should be used. In general, a more conservative approach is preferable, where the capital is kept more or less constant considering the withdrawing and inflation, -the case where the capital is entirely used until the "end" seems more of an edge case at the moment-. 
To do this, we should first define the account attributes linked to a specific person, which should be shared with the Person and Household class. Also, other types of investments should be considered in addition to just bonds, shares, and cash. A return should be estimated for these investments (probably this parameter should be set as default values and then have the possibility to specify it according to specific needs). Also, a safe rate of withdrawal, which could be considered around 3%, should be picked for the simulation. This could be considered a safe average between a higher and a lower rate that should be able to keep the capital more or less consistent, considering the volatility of the market in the short run. Additionally, inflation should be considered, probably at the beginning keeping it constant at the Fed's target.

For the tax bracket, this is the part where I have the most doubts, considering that it is generally progressive with customarily tax-bracket. Additionally, different investment movements and accounts have different rules, so this should be the part with more attention and research.

For the actual simulation of the probability of success, I thought of doing this, but I'm quite new to this simulation scenario, so here is where I think I need some guidance:

I thought about the obvious choice so Monte Carlo simulations  to model the uncertainty in financial planning. So simulate a large number of possible future outcomes based on random sampling of variables.

After having defined the initial conditions. These conditions include the current age, retirement age, life expectancy, current savings, and income. These parameters set the baseline for the simulation and help determine the starting point for future projections.

Next, we generate random variables for each year of the simulation. These random variables include investment returns, inflation rates, and any other stochastic variables that can impact the financial plan. The randomness in these variables allows the simulation to capture a wide range of possible future scenarios, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in financial markets and economic conditions.

 typically after a huge number of simulation, let's say 10,000 scenarios or more. In each iteration, the random variables are varied, and the retirement savings are projected forward year by year. This process generates a distribution of possible outcomes, providing a comprehensive view of potential future financial states.

To calculate the outcomes, we determine the end balance of retirement savings for each scenario. This involves applying the mathematical formulation of the savings balance over time. Specifically, the savings at time \( t \) ( \( S_t \) ) is calculated as follows:

\[ S_t = S_{t-1} \times (1 + r_t) - W_t \]

where \( S_t \) is the savings at time \( t \), \( r_t \) is the annual return at time \( t \) (randomly generated based on expected return and volatility), and \( W_t \) is the annual withdrawal at time \( t \) (adjusted for inflation).

Finally, we estimate the probability of success by calculating the proportion of simulations where the retirement savings are sufficient to cover expenses until the end of life expectancy. This metric provides a clear indication of the likelihood that the financial plan will meet its goals, helping to inform decision-making and adjustments to the plan as needed.



### Bullet Points

1. **Account Attributes**:
    - Linked to specific persons
    - Shared with Person and Household classes

2. **Investment Types**:
    - Bonds
    - Shares
    - Cash
    - Other investments (to be defined)
    - Default return values (modifiable)

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
    - Safe withdrawal rate: ~3%
    - Conservative approach to maintain capital
    - Consider market volatility

4. **Inflation**:
    - Initial assumption: constant at Fed's target rate

5. **Tax Brackets**:
    - Progressive structure
    - Different rules for various investment accounts
    - Requires detailed research and attention


## 07/06/2024

- **Exported Methods in NAMESPACE:**
  - Used `roxygen2` to export various methods into the NAMESPACE file. This ensures that the functions and methods I created are properly documented and made available for use when the package is loaded. This step is crucial for the correct functioning of the package as it specifies which functions are to be exported and available for users.

## 08/06/2024

- **Tested and Built the Package:**
  - Conducted  testing of the package to ensure all components work as expected. This involved running existing tests and making sure that all features are functioning correctly.
  - Updated the DESCRIPTION file automatically. This file contains metadata about the package such as the title, version, authors, and dependencies. Keeping it updated ensures that all package information is current and accurate.
  
- **Learned and Built Vignette:**
  - Created a vignette as both an example and a test. Vignettes are long-form documentation that provide users with comprehensive examples and explanations of the package's functionality. Although I decided not to push it yet, creating it helped me understand how to work with it.

## 09/06/2024

- **Uploaded Unit Tests for Household and Person:**
  - Developed and uploaded unit tests specifically for the Household and Person classes. These tests are designed to verify that individual units of code (i.e., functions and methods) work as intended.
  - Ran the tests and confirmed that they all passed, indicating that the code for these components is functioning correctly.

- **NAMESPACE File Push Consideration:**
  - Encountered a doubt regarding whether to push the NAMESPACE file. Since this file is automatically generated by `roxygen2` with the `document()` function, it raises the question of whether it should be included in version control throughout the development process or only at the end. 
  
-I had forgotten to push the various updates to the developer log on the previous days :')

## 10/06/2024

#### Overview
I began testing the implementation of the account attribute and associated methods within the household class of the `RetirementAnalytics` package. This involved adding functionality to handle accounts linked to specific persons and ensuring that these updates were correctly reflected in the summary outputs.

#### Issues Encountered

1. **Summary Display Issues:**
   - While testing, I encountered issues with the summary function. Specifically, the summary was not displaying the account balances that were added and linked to specific persons within the household. This required debugging to ensure that the account information was correctly integrated and displayed within the person and household summaries.

2. **Testing New Functionalists:**
   - I faced a doubt regarding the best approach to test additional functionalists within a class. The primary question was whether I should copy all the existing code into a sandbox environment and then add the new functionalists for testing, or if it was sufficient to create and test the new functionalists in a separate file without duplicating all the existing code.
  

3. **Library Loading Issues:**
   - Another problem occurred when I attempted to load the `RetirementAnalytics` package using `library(RetirementAnalytics)`. Despite the package passing all checks and being loadable through `devtools`, the standard library call resulted in an error. This discrepancy suggested there might be an issue with the package installation or namespace configuration that needed further investigation.

#### Steps Taken to Resolve Issues

 **Fixing Summary Display:**
   - I carefully reviewed the summary functions to ensure that the account balances were correctly integrated. This involved modifying the `summary.Person` and `summary.Household` functions to include calls to the `summary.Accounts` function, ensuring that all relevant information was displayed.(still not fixed)




## 12/06/2024

Meeting: We started to plan the draft of the `Scenario` class. We modified the constructor, using structure and making it inherit from the list. In addition, we decided to start with a simple scenario using multivariate bootstrap with a simple portfolio with automatic rebalancing. The `Account` should be a class of its own, with a flag indicating if it is taxable, non-taxable, or deferred taxable.

## 13/06/2024

Refactored the pre-existing `Person` class. Added unit tests to ensure the `Person` class functions correctly after the modifications. Began outlining the `Account` class, focusing on its attributes and methods related to tax status.
For this class I had to use upper case due to a conflict with another package class definition. 

## 14/06/2024

Started the initial implementation of the `Account` class with attributes for different tax statuses (taxable, non-taxable, deferred taxable). Added preliminary methods to handle account-specific operations. Modified unit tests to include the `Account` class and verified its basic functionality.

## 15/06/2024

Enhanced the `Person` class to better integrate with the new `Account` class. Refined the initial structure and methods of the `Account` class for improved performance. Conducted preliminary tests to validate the operations of both classes.



## 17/06/2024

Continued development of the `Account` class, adding more detailed attributes and methods. Conducted a code review and performed initial testing to ensure robustness and accuracy. Began modifications to the `Household` class for integration with the `Account` and `Person` classes. Prepared for the next phase of development

##18/06/2024

I've started learning about the R environment. This  is particularly focused on how the R environment can be leveraged for the scenario analysis, specifically in terms of evaluating returns on various asset classes. The objective is to streamline the process of calculating returns by focusing on the values stored in the environment, thus minimizing the need for repetitive calculations and optimizing efficiency.

##19/06/2024

Pushed the constructor of account in the sandbox. I have some doubts about how the various assets should be stored there. I don't know exactly how we are planning on creating these assets and how they should be accessible in order to be used for further analysis. I was simply thinking of a list of lists, but now I'm looking at some packages to simulate assets and returns, considering how to make them compatible with the `account` class.

##21/06/2024

#### Updates to Account Class

Pushed some updates and changes to the `account` class. I am building it with the capability to store a `portfolio` object so that we can retrieve it, run simulations, and return the outcomes. 

In general, I'm considering a `portfolio` object created with the `portfolio.spec` function from the `PortfolioAnalytics` package, as we will use this for rebalancing, returns, and managing all portfolio-related operations.

I still have some doubts about how the portfolio should be stored, especially because, even though it is conceptually simple, it is still a little bit obscure how the environment for the return should work and how I should set up the bootstrapping for the scenario analysis.

## 24/06/2024

#### Study and Research on Environment Setup

Spent time understanding how the environment should be configured for portfolio returns. Into the `PortfolioAnalytics` package documentation and  vignettes to comprehend the requirements and best practices for setting up the return environment. Specifically focused on:
- How to input historical return data .
- Methods for specifying constraints and objectives in the portfolio.
- Techniques for simulating returns using bootstrapping and other statistical methods.

## 25/06/2024

#### Sandbox Implementation for Account Class


- Created a method `add_portfolio` to include a `portfolio` object.
- Implemented basic retrieval of the `portfolio` object for further analysis and simulation.

## 26/06/2024

#### Environment and Bootstrapping for Scenario Analysis

Deepened understanding of bootstrapping techniques for scenario analysis:
- Studied various bootstrapping methods to generate synthetic return series.
- Tested different scenarios to evaluate the robustness of the portfolio under simulated market conditions.

## 27/06/2024

#### Improvements to Account Class

Made some small updates to the `account` class:
- Added basic functionality to specify different bootstrapping parameters.
- Created a simple method to run and return basic results of the scenario analysis.


## 28/06/2024

#### Paper Summary

Read a paper titled "Beyond Markowitz: A Comprehensive Wealth Allocation Framework for Individual Investors," shared on the Slack package channel. The paper introduces a wealth allocation framework that builds on Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) by incorporating personal and aspirational risk factors, in addition to market risk, to better suit individual investors'

## 1/07/2024

## Overview

The main tasks involved managing portfolio objects within an environment and implementing a method to estimate portfolio returns using a multivariate bootstrap approach.

### Setting Up Portfolio Environment

- Created a new environment, `portfolio_env`, to store and manage portfolio objects. This environment allows for efficient access and manipulation of portfolios by their names.

### Functions for Managing Portfolio Objects

- Implemented several functions to manage portfolios within the `portfolio_env` environment:

  - `add_existing_portfolio_to_env`: Adds a given portfolio to the environment.
  - `add_return_to_env_portfolio`: Adds a return value to a specified portfolio in the environment.
  - `get_env_portfolio_returns`: Retrieves the returns from a specified portfolio in the environment.
  - `calculate_env_portfolio_total_return`: Calculates the total return of a specified portfolio in the environment.

### Estimating Portfolio Returns Using Multivariate Bootstrap

- Implemented the `estimate_portfolio_return` function to estimate the return of portfolios using a multivariate bootstrap method. This function includes options for rebalancing and setting a fixed withdrawal amount(this should be implemented I just state the logic).
