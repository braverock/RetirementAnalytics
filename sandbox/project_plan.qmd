## Background

Retirement planning is a task that is highly quantitative in nature but is dominated by a small number of large commercial software packages, and is opaque to the open science analyst.  The code and techniques for effective retirement portfolio planning should be open source.

## Related work

This project should make use of existing work in the R ecosystem such as [PortfolioAnalytics](https://github.com/braverock/PortfolioAnalytics/) and [PerformanceAnalytics](https://github.com/braverock/PerformanceAnalytics/), and the proposed RetirementAnalytics package should focus on new functionality.

We can see how this book fits into the plan during the literature review: [Retirement Income Recipes in R](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-51434-1) with extras and code [here](https://moshemilevsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RiRiR_Solution_Manual_21FEB2021.pdf)

If we have additional time, we could model annuity assets in the retirement portfolio using calculations from a package 
like [vamc](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vamc/).

## Objectives/ Project Details

Our goal is to create a new package for retirement planning analytics including analysis of things such as:

- safe withdrawal rates
- strategies for withdrawal plans
- different portfolio plans
- Monte Carlo analysis with reasonable block samples and randomization
- tax optimization strategies

There are a few main pieces which could be accomplished in a GSoC:
- literature review (before coding starts, in collaboration with the mentors)
- framework for the package:
  - taking in deposits and withdrawals
  - asset returns for Monte Carlo and hypothetical portfolios
  - different account types for tax optimization purposes
  - different tax assumptions/regimes
- Monte Carlo simulation for 
  - asset returns and inflation
  - yields (not the same as returns, and very important to retirement planning)
  - CPI (might be commingled with yields, or might be somewhat independent)
  - plan duration (mortality of plan participants)
- required portfolio size:
  - using Monte Carlo assumptions
  - income/growth assuming size
  - required size given target income and Monte Carlo probabilities
- portfolio construction
  - portfolio optimization objectives and constraints
  - model multi-asset class benchmark portfolios ('better' than 60/40 domestic stock/bond)
  - model portfolios at the security level
  - inclusion of other income sources in plan (pensions, real estate, dividends)
- support for various withdrawal strategies
  - initial safe withdrawal rate (e.g. the 4% rule and its descendants)
  - guardrails approach
  - bucket plan
  - income portfolios
  - Social Security election timing


## Expected impact

Our goal during this project will be to establish a new package framework, and populate it 
with key analytical tools.

The internet is full of good and bad advice about retirement planning, but there are no 
open frameworks for doing advanced retirement planning analysis.  A simple retirement 
calculator with average rates of portfolio return is just a few lines of code in R or 
python, but more advanced analysis is required to do research or advisory work on
(potentially) real portfolios.

This project will establish an open framework under an open source license, and hopefully 
move the state of open science around retirement planning to new levels.  

The project should generate markdown vignettes as functionality is created.  These
should utilize open data sources (e.g. Federal Reserve, AQR, Dimson/Marsh/Staunton) 
where possible. After the initial framework is established, we should anticipate a 
vignette (or a significant new section on an existing vignette) approximately every 
one to two weeks.
 

## General Schedule

Here is a very high level schedule assuming a 12 week timeline (approximately 30 hours 
per week assuming Google's 350 hr project guideline).  Contributor proposals should 
create a more detailed task-oriented schedule aligned with the target completion timeline 
they want to aim for.

Pre-Work:
- reading literature and assembling bibliography
- finding existing code snippets and more detailed planning with mentor team

Week 1:
- package framework builds
- literature review in markdown as vignette

Weeks 2-4:
- data standards and examples
- Monte Carlo framework
  - asset returns
  - inflation
  - plan duration (mortality rate)
- retirement portfolio size estimator functions
- initial portfolio models (minimum variance and Markowitz, Black-Litterman)
- application of Monte Carlo returns to the portfolios

Weeks 5-8:
- standardized output of
  - return/risk metrics
  - withdrawals/portfolio value
  - success/failure rates, end of plan values
- withdrawal plan: initial safe withdrawal rate
- withdrawal plan: guardrails modifications of safe withdrawal rate
- withdrawal plan: actuarially modified withdrawal rates (RMD, Blanchet, et.al.)
- comparison of standardized outputs across different withdrawal plans

Weeks 9-12:
- withdrawal plan: bucket plan
- withdrawal plan: income portfolio (e.g. bonds, dividends)
- additional template portfolio optimization and rebalancing objectives
- model portfolios
- more vignettes and tests

## Tests

Contributors, please do one or more of the following tests before
contacting the mentors above.

### Monte Carlo Test: 

A key portion of this project will be constructing Monte Carlo simulations for asset returns as well as interest rates (on cash) and yields (on bonds or other fixed income assets, as well as dividends).  Demonstrate a multi-variable block bootstrap function with randomized block size and random noise parameters for the input time series.  Use xts time series and assume 'wide' data construction.

### Portfolio Construction Test:

Easy:

Use [PortfolioAnalytics](https://github.com/braverock/PortfolioAnalytics/) to construct and evaluate a multi-asset portfolio using a minimum variance and Markowitz portfolio.  Demonstrate comparing the outcome of the two portfolios using PortfolioAnalytics functions.

Hard:

Propose additional model portfolio objectives and constraints tailored to a retirement portfolio.  What risk metrics are appropriate?  why?  what return metrics should be used?  why?  compare your proposed retirement objective portfolio to the easy portfolios above

## Future Work

We would like to believe (despite historical evidence) that a superstar contributor will 
make short work of the proposed scope above, and that we will be able to move on to 
other advanced functionality.  It is far more likely that these topics will be areas 
for future work, perhaps even future GSoC's.

Some ideas for advanced topics in this field:

**Tax Strategy:**
- provide framework for modeling:
  - tax brackets 
  - capital gains taxes
  - dividend taxation
  - asset depreciation
  - taxable/tax deferred/non-taxable accounts 
- what assets should be in which accounts for tax reasons? (also known as "asset location" supplement to traditional asset allocation)
- in what order and proportions are taxes minimized during withdrawals?
- how do tax loss harvesting, depreciation, and other strategies fit in?

**Alternative Assets:**
- what are the tax and income implications of different alternative asset classes?
- Real Estate/REITS (related but different)
- Annuities (Fixed, Fixed Index, Variable, etc.)
- Alternative Yield Products (lending, financing)
- Alternative Asset Funds (Hedge Funds)
- Global Income Strategies

Use [PortfolioAnalytics](https://github.com/braverock/PortfolioAnalytics/) to construct and evaluate a multi-asset portfolio using a minimum variance and Markowitz portfolio.  Demonstrate comparing the outcome of the two portfolios using PortfolioAnalytics functions.

Hard:

Propose additional model portfolio objectives and constraints tailored to a retirement portfolio.  What risk metrics are appropriate?  why?  what return metrics should be used?  why?  compare your proposed retirement objective portfolio to the easy portfolios above

## Future Work

We would like to believe (despite historical evidence) that a superstar contributor will 
make short work of the proposed scope above, and that we will be able to move on to 
other advanced functionality.  It is far more likely that these topics will be areas 
for future work, perhaps even future GSoC's.

Some ideas for advanced topics in this field:

**Tax Strategy:**
- provide framework for modeling:
  - tax brackets 
  - capital gains taxes
  - dividend taxation
  - asset depreciation
  - taxable/tax deferred/non-taxable accounts 
- what assets should be in which accounts for tax reasons? (also known as "asset location" supplement to traditional asset allocation)
- in what order and proportions are taxes minimized during withdrawals?
- how do tax loss harvesting, depreciation, and other strategies fit in?

**Alternative Assets:**
- what are the tax and income implications of different alternative asset classes?
- Real Estate/REITS (related but different)
- Annuities (Fixed, Fixed Index, Variable, etc.)
- Alternative Yield Products (lending, financing)
- Alternative Asset Funds (Hedge Funds)
- Global Income Strategies

## Background

Retirement planning is a task that is highly quantitative in nature but is dominated by a small number of large commercial software packages, and is opaque to the open science analyst.  The code and techniques for effective retirement portfolio planning should be open source.

## Related work

This project should make use of existing work in the R ecosystem such as [PortfolioAnalytics](https://github.com/braverock/PortfolioAnalytics/) and [PerformanceAnalytics](https://github.com/braverock/PerformanceAnalytics/), and the proposed RetirementAnalytics package should focus on new functionality.

We can see how this book fits into the plan during the literature review: [Retirement Income Recipes in R](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-51434-1) with extras and code [here](https://moshemilevsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RiRiR_Solution_Manual_21FEB2021.pdf)

If we have additional time, we could model annuity assets in the retirement portfolio using calculations from a package 
like [vamc](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vamc/).

## Objectives/ Project Details

Our goal is to create a new package for retirement planning analytics including analysis of things such as:

- safe withdrawal rates
- strategies for withdrawal plans
- different portfolio plans
- Monte Carlo analysis with reasonable block samples and randomization
- tax optimization strategies

There are a few main pieces which could be accomplished in a GSoC:
- literature review (before coding starts, in collaboration with the mentors)
- framework for the package:
  - taking in deposits and withdrawals
  - asset returns for Monte Carlo and hypothetical portfolios
  - different account types for tax optimization purposes
  - different tax assumptions/regimes
- Monte Carlo simulation for 
  - asset returns and inflation
  - yields (not the same as returns, and very important to retirement planning)
  - CPI (might be commingled with yields, or might be somewhat independent)
  - plan duration (mortality of plan participants)
- required portfolio size:
  - using Monte Carlo assumptions
  - income/growth assuming size
  - required size given target income and Monte Carlo probabilities
- portfolio construction
  - portfolio optimization objectives and constraints
  - model multi-asset class benchmark portfolios ('better' than 60/40 domestic stock/bond)
  - model portfolios at the security level
  - inclusion of other income sources in plan (pensions, real estate, dividends)
- support for various withdrawal strategies
  - initial safe withdrawal rate (e.g. the 4% rule and its descendants)
  - guardrails approach
  - bucket plan
  - income portfolios
  - Social Security election timing


## Expected impact

Our goal during this project will be to establish a new package framework, and populate it 
with key analytical tools.

The internet is full of good and bad advice about retirement planning, but there are no 
open frameworks for doing advanced retirement planning analysis.  A simple retirement 
calculator with average rates of portfolio return is just a few lines of code in R or 
python, but more advanced analysis is required to do research or advisory work on
(potentially) real portfolios.

This project will establish an open framework under an open source license, and hopefully 
move the state of open science around retirement planning to new levels.  

The project should generate markdown vignettes as functionality is created.  These
should utilize open data sources (e.g. Federal Reserve, AQR, Dimson/Marsh/Staunton) 
where possible. After the initial framework is established, we should anticipate a 
vignette (or a significant new section on an existing vignette) approximately every 
one to two weeks.
 

## General Schedule

Here is a very high level schedule assuming a 12 week timeline (approximately 30 hours 
per week assuming Google's 350 hr project guideline).  Contributor proposals should 
create a more detailed task-oriented schedule aligned with the target completion timeline 
they want to aim for.

Pre-Work:
- reading literature and assembling bibliography
- finding existing code snippets and more detailed planning with mentor team

Week 1:
- package framework builds
- literature review in markdown as vignette

Weeks 2-4:
- data standards and examples
- Monte Carlo framework
  - asset returns
  - inflation
  - plan duration (mortality rate)
- retirement portfolio size estimator functions
- initial portfolio models (minimum variance and Markowitz, Black-Litterman)
- application of Monte Carlo returns to the portfolios

Weeks 5-8:
- standardized output of
  - return/risk metrics
  - withdrawals/portfolio value
  - success/failure rates, end of plan values
- withdrawal plan: initial safe withdrawal rate
- withdrawal plan: guardrails modifications of safe withdrawal rate
- withdrawal plan: actuarially modified withdrawal rates (RMD, Blanchet, et.al.)
- comparison of standardized outputs across different withdrawal plans

Weeks 9-12:
- withdrawal plan: bucket plan
- withdrawal plan: income portfolio (e.g. bonds, dividends)
- additional template portfolio optimization and rebalancing objectives
- model portfolios
- more vignettes and tests

## Tests

Contributors, please do one or more of the following tests before
contacting the mentors above.

### Monte Carlo Test: 

A key portion of this project will be constructing Monte Carlo simulations for asset returns as well as interest rates (on cash) and yields (on bonds or other fixed income assets, as well as dividends).  Demonstrate a multi-variable block bootstrap function with randomized block size and random noise parameters for the input time series.  Use xts time series and assume 'wide' data construction.

### Portfolio Construction Test:

Easy:

Use [PortfolioAnalytics](https://github.com/braverock/PortfolioAnalytics/) to construct and evaluate a multi-asset portfolio using a minimum variance and Markowitz portfolio.  Demonstrate comparing the outcome of the two portfolios using PortfolioAnalytics functions.

Hard:

Propose additional model portfolio objectives and constraints tailored to a retirement portfolio.  What risk metrics are appropriate?  why?  what return metrics should be used?  why?  compare your proposed retirement objective portfolio to the easy portfolios above

make short work of the proposed scope above, and that we will be able to move on to 
other advanced functionality.  It is far more likely that these topics will be areas

- in what order and proportions are taxes minimized during withdrawals?
- how do tax loss harvesting, depreciation, and other strategies fit in?

**Alternative Assets:**
- what are the tax and income implications of different alternative asset classes?
- Real Estate/REITS (related but different)
- Annuities (Fixed, Fixed Index, Variable, etc.)
- Alternative Yield Products (lending, financing)
- Alternative Asset Funds (Hedge Funds)
- Global Income Strategies
