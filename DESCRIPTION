Description: Retirement planning is a task that is highly quantitative in nature 
    but is dominated by a small number of large commercial software packages, 
    and is opaque to the open science analyst.  The RetirementAnalytics 
    package includes code and techniques for effective retirement portfolio 
    planning under an open source/open science framework.
    
    The projections and other information generated by RetirementAnalytics 
    regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in 
    nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of 
    future results. Distributions of return outcomes from RetirementAnalytics
    are derived from simulations for each modeled asset class. Results from the 
    model may vary with each use and over time.
